In this study, we present the development of PODIO (POlitical DIscourse Ontology), an ontology designed to formalize the dissemination of political discourse in digital media. The core contribution of this work lies in the creation of an ontology that enables systematic organization and representation of political discourse. This is crucial in political communication research to understand and analyze political debates on various digital platforms. This ontology is specifically designed to capture the complexities of political communication, including analysis of political proposals, ideological foundations, target audiences, and the temporal context of discourse. Furthermore, through the integration of diverse existing datasets into a Knowledge Graph, we demonstrate the effectiveness of PODIO in encapsulating a broad spectrum of political discourses.
