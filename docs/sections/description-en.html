The overview of the ontology is depicted in **Figure 1**. In order to build
the model, we extend the [SIOC ontology](http://rdfs.org/sioc/spec/) and reuse several additional
ontologies (SCHEMA, ORG, DC). The ontology revolves around the concept of
_Speech_ (`speech:Speech`), that represents both _Tweets_
(`speech:Tweet`) and _Political Party Manifestos_
(`PoliticalPartyManifesto`). A _Speech_ has a creator (`foaf:Agent`),
that may hold an online account (`foaf:OnlineAccount`); may be associated with
an ideology (extracted from the [UNESCO SKOS Theraurus](https://skos.um.es/unescothes/))
and a subject (i.e. Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) extracted from the [SDG SKOS
Taxonomy](https://metadata.un.org/sdg/)); and an interaction
statistics (`schema:InteractionCounter`), that represents metrics such as number
of retweets and likes for _Tweets_, that represents metrics such as number of retweets
and likes for _social posts_. For instance, the following excerpt shows an
instance of _Speech_, a _tweet_ that is created by the account of
the _PSOE_ political party, with the date it was created and the number of
likes obtained.

```
:Tweet/107275 a speech:Speech ;
  sioc:has_creator :TwitterUser/PSOE ;
  dc:created "2018-12-12 07:18:02" ;
  schema:interactionStatistic [
    schema:interactionType schema:UserLikes ;
    schema:userInteractionCount 178 ] .
```


The SIOC ontology is imported to leverage the representation of _Tweets_
(as subclass of `sioc:Post`), _Twitter Users_ (`speech:TwitterUser`
as subclass of `sioc:UserAccount`), quoted tweets (with `sioc: quote\_of`),
 threads and hashtags (represented within `sioc:Container`).
We extend `speech:Tweet` w.r.t. `sioc:Post` to include shared content,
e.g. images, videos (`schema:sharedContent`) and be able to have retweeted
`Tweets` by _Twitter Users_ (using `speech:retweets`).
In addition, a _Twitter User_ may be associated with an ideology, in the
same way as _Speech_. The following excerpt shows an example of the
_Twitter User_ PSOE Madrid with its ideology and some retweeted posts.

```
:TwitterUser/psoe_m a speech:TwitterUser ;
  speech:ideology &lt;https://skos.um.es/unescothes/C03734> ;
  speech:retweets :Tweet/102913 .
```


_Political Party Manifestos_ may include several _olitical Proposals_
(`speech:PoliticalProposal`), that can be associated with a SDG, in the
same way as _Speech_. _Political Party Manifestos_ may also propose
a candidate (with `speech:proposesPoliticalCandidate`) and have an official
_Hashtag_ (`speech:Hashtag`). Lastly, _Political Parties_
(`speech:PoliticalParty`) are represented as subclasses of `org:Organization`.
The local and regional subsidiaries of _Political Parties_ are defined as
suborganizations of the national-level party (with `org:subOrganizationOf`).The excerpt below shows an instance of \textit{Political Party Manifesto} with the proposing political candidate and a proposal referring to the Sustainable Development Goal 11.


```
:PoliticalPartyManifesto/PPMadrid/2019
  a speech:PoliticalPartyManifesto ;
  speech:proposesPoliticalCandidate :Person/IsabelDiazAyuso;
  dc:hasPart [ a speech:PoliticalProposal ;
    dc:subject &lt;https://metadata.un.org/sdg/11> ] .

```
