<span class="markdown">This research addresses the need for the systematic organization and integration of political discourse, regardless of the communication channels employed, whether rooted in social platforms or dissemination channels. The aim is to facilitate nuanced and advanced analyses that consider specific aspects of the political domain, including the persuasive nature of discourse, the ideological basis of the messages, the targeted audience (wether groups or comcommunities), and the temporal context of communication. The resulting ontology, named PODIO (POlitical DIscourse Ontology), offers a structured framework to enhance the understanding of political debate.</span>
